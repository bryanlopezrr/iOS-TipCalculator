## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

XCode would be buggy at times. For instance when I linked some of the labels using 'control^' + drag
the weak variable would throw a thread exception everytime I would load the app. 
Another using was displaying the keyboard. Although I toggled the appropriate setting to display the 
keyboard, it would not show when running the app
